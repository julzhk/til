TIL: Panda3d

I've been learning Blender over the last few weeks. Hence fewer TILs (it'd be TIL Blender this, TIL Blender that, day after day..) Anyway, now I'm getting somewhere with it I was wondering if 
there's any 3d game engine's that I could use my new models with.

Enter [Panda3d](http://panda3d.org).

Panda3d is Python-based, which is convenient. And indeed, I could get my low-poly t.rex to drift around in 3D in a few minutes. Not walking, drifting. Dull colours, and no texture. But it is 3D 
and it is my model, so I'm happy with the small incremental achievement.
