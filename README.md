# TIL - Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a

warrant a full blog post. Inspired by 
[jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and https://til.simonwillison.net. A discussion about it in [this blog post](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9). Eg: A

There'll be stuff here which will be 'I can't believe I only today learned this!' as well as 'That's cool and novel and clever'.

Now I've started - some of it will be: 
* 'I'm learning this now & I want to remember this for the future' 
* ... as well as: 'I'm realising I want to retain this and making notes helps me consolidate and retain this info'
