TIL Gemini code assistant is now in Pycharm
--

Pycharm has a vibrant plugin eco-system. Lots of neato tools. For instance, I really like '[String manipulation' plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/2162-stringmanipulation) - if there's a 
list,
I'll want it sorted alphabetically.

Anyhoo, this is new: Gemini coding tool has a [plug-in](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24198-gemini-code-assist). So now I'm evaluating Junie, Copilot and now Gemini. 

So far, I'm treating Gen-AI as a talented junior developer: keep them on a short leash and give careful guidance, but within those guardrails, they can give surprising work. 

& both surprisingly good and bad.
