[JustHTML](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml) : A harbinger of things to come: 'Vibe Engineering': Developer as Centaur: Decisions and design by the developer, but the actual coding by Gen 
AI Agents. 

Found via Simon Willison's Wrap-up of 2025 + predictions [blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/8/llm-predictions-for-2026/) & [justhtml here](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/) 

Always find something thought-provoking in his blog posts. I respect that he's finding GenAI productive and useful without appearing to be a hype-peddling booster. 

Can't imagine how he maintains that degree of productivity and focus; even in spite of his expert GenAI usage. It might be massively quicker to use GenAI, but it still takes time.
