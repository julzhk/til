TIL: Blender

This is more than a day's worth of learning! I've been doing learning it over the past few weeks. 

It's a huge undertaking but I was inspired by a video 'How far can I get in 100 learning hours of Blender?' or smth. Edit: [link](https://nebula.tv/videos/sarahrenaeclark-i-spent-100-hours-learning-blender) - (shout out to the Nebula app: highly recommended.)

So I subscribed to an online course: with a tricky UI, I found a video guide worked better than books.

I guess TIL: Blender supports Python scripting. This gives me the goal of making 3D fractal fly throughs.
