Was approached for a seemingly legitimate opportunity via my Github profile.

We move from a brief email chat to a scheduled whatsapp conversation.

Next red flag: their Whatsapp number isn't dialable...odd! - and they want to move to a different platform. Which is a typical scammer behaviour.

Tbh this wasn't the first 'stand-in' worker fraud I've been approached for. But it particularly well prepared - spoof email accounts associated with a nice portfolio site. A credible Whatsapp

I just can't imagine a scam like this not being detected by a company in a very short order. And it's so obviously fraud. I guess somebody'll go for it but I can't imagine many.
