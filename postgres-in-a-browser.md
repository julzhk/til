TIL: Postgres in a browser
-
How interesting: [PGLite](https://pglite.dev/docs/)

Implemented here : https://dbfor.dev

And similarly: https://docs.doltgres.com : 'version control for databases' which nicely seems to work in Django. https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-24-doltgres-django/ - obviously, Django and 
sqlite work well together, but it's nice to have available the really nice Postgres only features. eg: JSON fields and so on - and (apparently) proper concurrency and other Pg features.
