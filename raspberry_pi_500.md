TIL: Raspberry Pi 500+ is a thing
--

This has been released recently. I recall it being discussed for years, so now it's finally here! Very interesting! I love tinkering with Raspberry Pi but it's a bit inconvenient to connect to 
them sometimes: connecting up the necessary input peripherals is a bit annoying. 

So this will make that a bit more convenient. And it's a real standalone computer. $200 seems not too expensive.
