TIL: A library to pack 3d objects.

I was asked (in a pub years ago) about optimizing fabric cutting: How to cut shapes from a fabric and minimize the waste.

Because it's actually a really hard problem, I chewed it over a bit and moved on. But when it comes up, it tweaks my interest.

Very much a problem with trade-offs between speed and quality. Finding the very best solution is probably too time-consuming for real life. But good enough is good enough.

'psacking' is a library for this.

This solves an even harder problem: It packs random shapes in 3d.

Especially nice for the super animation showing the packing result.

[Allows packing from STL files too](https://github.com/Vrroom/psacking?tab=readme-ov-file#packing-from-stl-files) - so can use it to pack 3d print outputs.
